# Functions

## 1. Minimum of an array
Returns the smallest number in the array.

## 2. Average of an array
Returns the average value of all elements of the array.

## 3. Prime number check
You are given a number `n`, write the function for checking whether `n` is prime.

## 4. Factorial calculation
You are given a number `n`, write the program using recursion for finding `n!`.

## 5. Fibonacci sequence
You are given a number `n`, write the function for finding the `n`-th element in the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.  
Formula: `Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2`, where `F0 = 0`, `F1 = 1`.

## 6. Power calculation
You are given numbers `a` and `n`, write the function that returns `a^n`.

## 7. Reverse an array
You are given a number `n` and an array of `n` elements, write the program that returns the given array in reverse order without using an array data structure.
(Recursion)

## 8. Check if a string consists of digits
You are given a string `s`, write the function for checking whether `s` consists only of digits.

## 9. Binomial coefficient calculation
You are given numbers `n` and `k`, write the program that finds `C(n, k)` (binomial coefficient) using the formula:  
`C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k)`, where `C(n, 0) = C(n, n) = 1`.

## 10. Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
You are given `a` and `b`, write the function for finding `GCD(a, b)` using recursion.
